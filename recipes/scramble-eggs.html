  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Scrambled eggs are eggs beaten and cooked in a pan until softly set,
    often with milk or cream, seasoned with salt and pepper. They're stirred
    as they cook to create creamy curds. They're a versatile dish enjoyed
    on their own or with added ingredients like cheese, vegetables, or meats.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul id="ingredients">
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol id="steps">
    <li>Crack the desired number of eggs into a bowl. The usual serving size is about 2-3 eggs per person.</li>
    <li>Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are well mixed and the mixture appears slightly frothy.</li>
    <li>Add a splash of milk to the beaten eggs. The milk helps make the eggs fluffier and creamier. Use roughly 1-2 tablespoons of milk per 2-3 eggs.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper into the egg mixture. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.</li>
    <li>Whisk or stir the egg mixture again to ensure that the milk, salt, and pepper are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-low heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil and let it melt and coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mixture into the heated pan.</li>
    <li>As the eggs start to cook, use a spatula to gently stir and scrape the eggs from the edges of the pan towards the center. This will create small curds.</li>
    <li>Adjust the heat as needed to prevent the eggs from cooking too quickly. The goal is to have gentle, slow cooking for creamy scrambled eggs.</li>
    <li>Continue stirring and cooking the eggs until they are softly set but still slightly creamy. If you prefer drier eggs, cook them a bit longer.</li>
    <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, immediately remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the eggs slightly.</li>
    <li>Plate the scrambled eggs and enjoy them while they're still warm.</li>
  </ol>
