  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A juicy and flavorful steak that is very straightforward. 
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul id="ingredients">
    <li>1 boneless steak</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>butter</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>rosemary</li>
    <li>garlic cloves</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol id="steps">
    <li>Prepare the steak by letting it sit outside the refrigerator and reaching room temp to cook even.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of the steak generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place a cast iron pan over medium-high heat and add oil.</li>
    <li>
      Place the steak on the hot pan and allow it to sear for about 4 minutes for medium-rare.
      Flip the steak and cook for similar time.
    </li>
    <li>
      About a minute before the steak is cooked add in butter, garlic cloves, and rosemerry
      for extra flavor. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter onto the steak.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the steak from the pan let it rest on a cutting board or plate for a few minutes.
      This allows the juices to redistribute resulting into a jucier steak.
    </li>
    <li>Slice the steak against the grain to ensure tenderness. Plate the steak and serve.</li>
  </ol>
